   <h1>This is my first semester of my first year</h1>
    
   <p> during my first year in college I took CSC 106 and learned JavaScript. While I never learned JavaScript or Html before, <br>
        but I took a class in highschool learnig python so I understood how coding works and a breif understanding of how to get into a coding mindspace. <br>

   <h3> First thing I coded in my CSC 106 class</H3>
   
   <p>While this was the first project we made for the class it was defently not the least important.<br>
    We were tasked to make bitmojis off of pictures we have of outselves, this project was used in nearly<br>
    every project that we did. I was able to learn the basics of JavaScript through it and how different  </p>

    <h4> Last thing I coded in my CSC 106 class</h4>
    
    <p> This was a group code project for our final, my partner and I Decided to code deal or no deal.<br>
    We used all our knowledge of arrays, loops, function, objects to put it all togethor. It was really fun to code<br>
    and at the end we showed it to different highschool students interested in computer science which makes it a even better experience.</p>
