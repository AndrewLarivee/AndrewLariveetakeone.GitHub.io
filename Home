   <h1> Welcome to Andrew's programming portfolio</h1>
    
   <p> On this wedsite I (Andrew Larivee) will be adding all of my work from my CSC 106 class. <br>
    you should expect the page to get better as my skills do at the same time, I also believe <br>
    you will be able to see all different code languages and the use of them through the page.</p>
